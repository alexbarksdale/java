# Notes I'll probably forget

## Static methods
- Static methods can't access instance methods and instance variables directly.
- They are usually used for operations that don't require any data from an instance of the class (from 'this')
    - Can't use 'this'

- If you see a method that **does not use instance variables** that method should be declared as a static method.
